# AI Voice Assistant for Homey

<img src="./assets/images/large.png" alt="App banner" />

A Homey app that connects small ESP32-based voice devices to OpenAI so you can talk to your smart home. The app bridges onâ€‘device microphones/speakers with cloud STT/LLM/TTS, exposes handy Flow cards, and keeps things simple enough to flash and use on inexpensive hardware.

> **Status:** Early preview. See [todo.md](./todo.md) for planned features and open tasks.

## Supported devices

### 1) Home Assistant Voice: Preview Edition (PE)

<img src="./drivers/home-assistant-voice-preview-edition/assets/images/large.png" height="160" alt="Voice PE" />

**Firmware**: Official ESPHome firmware.

**How to flash / (re)install**

1. Use a Chromiumâ€‘based browser (Chrome/Edge) that supports Web Serial.
2. Open the installer: [https://esphome.github.io/home-assistant-voice-pe/](https://esphome.github.io/home-assistant-voice-pe/)
3. Click **Connect**, choose the deviceâ€™s COM/USB port.
4. Pick a firmware version and click **Install**.
5. When prompted, enter your Wiâ€‘Fi credentials.
6. After boot, optionally assign a **static IP** in your router/DHCP.

**Tips**

* You can update/monitor later using the ESPHome Web tools.
* If the device doesnâ€™t appear for OTA updates, try powerâ€‘cycling and ensure your network resolves the device hostname.

### 2) XiaoZhi AI devices (RealDeco firmware)

<img src="./.resources/devices_4.png" height="160" alt="XiaoZhi AI" />

**Firmware**: Community ESPHome configs by RealDeco.

**How to flash**

1. Connect the XiaoZhi via USB.
2. Go to the RealDeco repo for your model: [https://github.com/RealDeco/xiaozhi-esphome](https://github.com/RealDeco/xiaozhi-esphome)
3. Use **ESPHome Web** ([https://web.esphome.io/](https://web.esphome.io/)) to do the first flash if needed.
4. In ESPHome, create or take over the device, paste the config from the repo, keep the **device name** unchanged, and install.
5. Firstâ€‘time install may require USB flashing to update partitions; later you can update OTA.

**Notes**

* Some models have different screens/touch optionsâ€”use the matching YAML.
* If a device gets stuck after a wrong name/config, enter bootloader (usually holding/combining buttons) and reâ€‘flash over USB.

## OpenAI API key

This app uses OpenAI for speechâ€‘toâ€‘text, reasoning, and textâ€‘toâ€‘speech.

**Create an API key**

1. Sign in at [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Go to **API keys** (account/organization settings) and **Create new secret key**.
3. Copy the key and keep it secret; youâ€™ll paste it into the app settings in Homey.

**Where to put the key in Homey**

* Open the app **Settings** in the Homey mobile/web app.
* Paste your **OpenAI API key**, then save.



> If your OpenAI account is new, you may need to add billing to enable API usage.

## Quick start

1. **Flash** your device (PE or XiaoZhi) using the steps above and connect it to Wiâ€‘Fi.
2. **Install** this app on your Homey.
3. **Enter** your OpenAI API key in the app settings.
4. **Add** your device in Homey (pairing flow per driver).
5. **Test** by running the *Start voice session* action from a Flow, or use the deviceâ€™s hardware button/wake word.

## Troubleshooting

* **Flashing/USB issues**: Try another USB cable/port; if needed, enter bootloader mode and reâ€‘flash.
* **Device not updating OTA**: Ensure itâ€™s online and reachable; verify hostname/DNS on your LAN.
* **No audio/response**: Check device volume (if applicable) and confirm your OpenAI key is set and valid.

---

## Privacy & security

* Your OpenAI API key stays in your Homey app settings.
* Audio and text are sent to OpenAI to fulfill requests. Do not use this app if thatâ€™s not acceptable for your environment.
